Large matrix multiplication using OPENMP construct


The program implements an efficient large matrix multiplication algorithm using ijk implementation method in OpenMP.OpenMP is an API 
which is used for writing multi-threaded application which works on fork join model.it contains a set of compiler directives and 
library routines for parallel application programs which greatly simplifies writing multi-threaded programs. An OpenMP framework 
often starts with a single control thread, called the master thread, which persists for program length. In this problem statement 
efficiency of traditional matrix multiplication, matrix multiplication using pragma parallel construct and an optimized matrix 
multiplication using pragma parallel construct has been analysed on the square matrix of different dimensions ranging from 
200 to 2000 with a step size of 200.
